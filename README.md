# jQuery AJAX Lecture Notes
This app requires you have installed and can run a local Node server.

## Installing Homebrew and Node.js (one-time)
1. [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). This will be done on the command line (Terminal)
2. Once Homebrew is installed, run the command: `brew install node`

## Running the Server and Application
In order for our app to run and serve the files we need, you'll need to run the server.

1. Download or fork (then clone) this project. Navigate to your project directory in Terminal.
2. Run the command: `npm install`
  2. This will install all of the required node packages our application requires.
  2. You should see a directory called 'node_modules' in your project now.
3. From the project directory, use the command: `npm start`
    3. You should see a message on the command line: 'Listening on port: 5000'
4. Go to http://localhost:5000 in your browser to see the index.html file in action

**NOTE Do not close this Terminal window as it is actively running the Node server**
If you need to issue any more commands, open another Terminal window (or tab)

## Making Changes
Make changes in the `/public/scripts`, `/public/styles`, and `public/views` folders. In order to see the changes, you need to restart the server.

1. In the Terminal window that is running the server, hit the keys Control + C (to Cancel). You will see: '^C'
2. Once changes are made, start the server again with: `npm start`
